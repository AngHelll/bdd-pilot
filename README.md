# BDD Pilot

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

**BDD Pilot** is an open-source VS Code extension that gives you a graphical
interface to discover, filter and run **Reqnroll / SpecFlow + xUnit** BDD tests
from `.feature` files — reliably, securely, and with actionable diagnostics.

It is framework-agnostic: it works with any .NET BDD project that runs through
`dotnet test`, regardless of domain (API tests, web/Playwright tests, etc.). No
project- or vendor-specific assumptions are baked in.

## BDD extension family

BDD Pilot focuses on **running** tests. For **navigation and step bindings**, use
[**BDD Guardian**](https://github.com/AngHelll/bdd-guardian) — they complement each
other and can be installed side by side:

| Extension | Role |
|-----------|------|
| [**BDD Guardian**](https://github.com/AngHelll/bdd-guardian) | Go to Definition, CodeLens on steps, binding diagnostics, Coach mode |
| **BDD Pilot** (this repo) | Test tree, `dotnet test` execution, TRX/Cucumber results, run history |

Guardian answers *“where is this step implemented?”* — Pilot answers *“run this
scenario and show me what failed.”*

## Features

### Discovery & run
- **Native Test Explorer** (`TestController`): Run and Debug profiles with results
  mapped back to scenarios, including rich failure messages.
- **BDD Pilot side view**: Domain → Feature → Scenario tree from `.feature` files,
  with tag badges. Domain grouping uses a `Feature/` or `Features/` folder.
- **CodeLens** on Feature and Scenario lines in `.feature` files (Run / Debug).
- **One-click run**: domain, feature, scenario, or tag — the correct
  `dotnet test --filter` is built automatically.
  - Feature → `FullyQualifiedName~<Feature>Feature`
  - Scenario → `FullyQualifiedName~<Feature>Feature.<Scenario>`
  - Tag → `Category=<tag>`
- **Tree search** to filter by name, tag, or path.
- **Re-run failed** from the last run's filter.
- **Saved execution profiles** for common filters.

### Environment & execution
- **Environment selector** (`dev`/`test`/`stg`/`prod`) in the status bar — sets
  `STAGE` for the run.
- **Parallelism mode** (`debug`/`parallel`/`ci`) passed as xUnit RunSettings, so
  the project's `xunit.runner.json` is never mutated on disk.
- **Reliable execution**: progress UI, cancellation, and live streaming to the
  *BDD Pilot* output channel.
- **Debug** launches `dotnet test` under the .NET debugger (`coreclr`).

### Results & diagnostics
- **TRX + Cucumber JSON**: scenarios decorated with pass / fail / skip and duration.
- **Webview dashboard**: run history, totals, and flaky scenario table.
- **Evidence links** on failures (screenshots, traces, videos when present).
- **Actionable diagnostics**: missing SDK from `global.json`, private NuGet feed/auth
  errors, vulnerability-as-error, filter mismatches, broken Playwright drivers, etc.

## Security

- The extension **never reads or stores credentials**. Secrets continue to come
  from the project's own `.env` mechanism.
- An optional `config/.env.<stage>` file is loaded into the test process's
  environment **in memory only** (never logged or persisted).
- All output is **sanitized** before being written to the channel (client
  secrets, passwords, tokens, JWTs, connection strings are redacted).
- Running against `stg`/`prod` requires an **explicit modal confirmation**
  (configurable).

## Architecture

```
src/
├── core/          # Pure logic, no VS Code API — unit tested
│   ├── gherkin/   # .feature parser, grouping, discovery
│   ├── runner/    # dotnet test arg/env building + spawn
│   ├── results/   # TRX + Cucumber parsers, evidence, run history
│   ├── diagnostics/ # error-output analyzer
│   └── config/    # stages, modes, profiles, project locator, .env loader
├── providers/     # Tree, TestController, CodeLens, dashboard, RunService
├── security/      # env guard policy + output sanitizer
└── extension.ts   # activation + commands wiring
```

The `core/` layer has no dependency on the VS Code API, so it is fully unit
testable and reusable (e.g. a future CLI).

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `bddPilot.projectPath` | `""` | Path to the .NET test project. Empty = auto-detect. |
| `bddPilot.defaultStage` | `test` | Default `STAGE`. |
| `bddPilot.defaultMode` | `debug` | Default parallelism mode. |
| `bddPilot.requireConfirmationForStages` | `["stg","prod"]` | Stages that require confirmation. |
| `bddPilot.dotnetPath` | `dotnet` | Path to the `dotnet` executable. |

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.90+
- .NET SDK (any feeds your project needs must be reachable / authenticated on
  your machine — BDD Pilot does not manage credentials)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run compile      # type-check
npm run lint
npm run test:unit    # core unit tests (node:test)
npm run build        # bundle with esbuild -> dist/extension.js
npm run package      # produce a .vsix
```

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). Current release is **v0.1.0** (pre-marketplace beta).
**Next up: Phase A** (Scenario Outline filters, tag inheritance), then Phase C
(marketplace, i18n, cross-links with [BDD Guardian](https://github.com/AngHelll/bdd-guardian)).
